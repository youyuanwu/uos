//! Shared executor + APIC-timer plumbing for the example kernels.
//!
//! Each example wires a slightly different bootloader, NIC driver, and
//! VMBus/IOAPIC IRQ source, but the *executor side* is identical:
//!
//! - APIC timer ISR that advances [`crate::time`] and EOIs the LAPIC.
//! - Spurious-vector ISR (required by APIC enable).
//! - A canonical executor loop that polls embassy and `hlt`s between
//!   interrupts.
//!
//! This module owns those pieces so the examples don't each re-implement
//! them. Device-specific ISRs stay in the example crate but call
//! [`lapic_eoi`] from here for the End-of-Interrupt write.
//!
//! ## Vectors used
//!
//! | Vector | Purpose |
//! |--------|---------|
//! | 32     | APIC periodic timer (drives `embassy_time` alarms) |
//! | 39     | Spurious interrupt (APIC requirement) |
//!
//! Examples should pick device IRQ vectors elsewhere (e.g., 33 for the
//! NIC, or whatever SynIC SINT vector the example uses).
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // After enabling LAPIC and calibrating TSC:
//! embclox_hal_x86::time::set_tsc_per_us(tsc_per_us);
//! embclox_hal_x86::idt::init();
//! embclox_hal_x86::runtime::start_apic_timer(lapic, tsc_per_us, 1_000);
//!
//! // ... spawn embassy tasks ...
//! embclox_hal_x86::runtime::run_executor(executor);  // never returns
//! ```
